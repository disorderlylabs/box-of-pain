Organization:
tracer === the main box--of--pain process, which traces the others
    |--- process_1 === Process to be traced
	:
    |--- process_n === Process to be traced


Use:
	painbox -C program [args]

	painbox -T
		Launch an interactive tracer mode. Takes in name pid pairs until told given ^D, then runs/traces them.
