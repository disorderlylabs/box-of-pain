Containerized box of Pain:
Split a box of pain across containers.

Organization:
tracer === the main box--of--pain process, which traces the others
    |--- process_1 === Process to be traced
	:
    |--- process_n === Process to be traced


Use:
Containers must be linked with the same pid namespace, and a shared /tracees directory.
Within a container, the following options are available:
	painbox [-d] -T
		Launch the tracer process. Do this first, then launch the tracees, then tell the tracer to continue (currently enter on stdin).
	painbox -C program [args]
		Launch a program to be traced in containerized mode. Prints its own pid to the /tracees directory and waits for a signal from the tracer.

TODO:

Make a more general docker image. Ideally, it could be built on top of the image to be traced, and possibly inherit its entrypoints.
