TODO 
- Document
- Figure out a metric to see if it's broken
- UDP example 
- Fix Docker/tracer.sh, Docker/tracee.sh
- Return values
- Outfile flag 

painbox args are e:E:dhTCfs:r:R:wSl:

#tracks new executable, complicated
e/E - e tracks exit code, E doesn't. Followed by comma-seperated arguments

d - options.dump
h - Help. Prints usage
T - containerization = MODE_T
C - containerization = MODE_C
f - ??? nothing. still included into it? maybe co-opt as a directory flag
s - serialize_run = optarg, current_run.name = optarg

#run options, makes a new run
r - no dump
R - dump

w - options.wait
S - options.step

l - sets logging types from sys/sock/follow/run/stats/exit

Containerization modes:
?? Found the answer to this somewhere

  The examples directory consists of a makefile, which is filled with example code. Each example program has its own folder
and corresponding makefile. It is expected (by a future testing script for all/some of the examples) that the program is 
in the root of the program's folder.

Note that client runs on 1234 and both server/quorum-server listen on port 1234

Makefile
  Mirrors the structure of the source directory in bin with .d/.o files instead of .cpp. Also removes the bin directory - don't set bin to anything important.


Docker
  For running scripts on host relating to docker. Requires docker to run

scripts
  Scripts to run in either docker or a native Linux environment


SOURCE CODE
  In general, box of pain intercepts and logs system calls in the run structure
